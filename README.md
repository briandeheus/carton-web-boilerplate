##Installation
First clone this repository via your favorite Git client. 

Next up in the root directory of the boilerplate run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

After you've installed all dependencies check if your configuration file `cfg/cfg.json` has the right settings.

Change the `server_name`, `root_directory` and the `port` in the `webserver.conf` file.

Restart Nginx

You should now be able to access your website at http://localhost:yourport or whatever you set the server_name to.
